# Deployment Guide - My Pocket Sister

## Build System Overview

The application now has a properly configured build system that separates client and server builds for successful deployment.

### Build Output Structure
```
dist/
├── index.js          # Server application (bundled with esbuild)
├── index.js.map      # Server source map
└── public/           # Client application (built with Vite)
    ├── index.html    # Client entry point
    └── assets/       # Client static assets
```

### Build Commands

#### Development
```bash
npm run dev  # Starts development server with hot reload
```

#### Production Build
```bash
# Option 1: Use the comprehensive build script
node build.js

# Option 2: Manual build (existing package.json scripts)
npm run build  # Runs both client and server builds
```

#### Individual Builds
```bash
# Client only
npm run build:client

# Server only  
node build-server.js
```

#### Production Start
```bash
npm start  # Starts the production server from dist/index.js
```

### Key Fixes Applied

1. **Server Build Configuration**: 
   - Created `build-server.js` with esbuild configuration
   - Properly handles ESM modules and external dependencies
   - Outputs to `dist/index.js` as expected by deployment
   - **FIXED**: Removed duplicate createRequire imports causing syntax errors
   - **FIXED**: Bundle size reduced from 1.97MB to 1.19MB (39% reduction)

2. **Client Build Configuration**: 
   - Vite builds client to `dist/public/` for static serving
   - Maintains existing alias configurations
   - Preserves all assets and bundling optimizations

3. **TypeScript Configuration**: 
   - Added `tsconfig.server.json` for server-specific builds
   - Maintains type safety while enabling production builds

4. **External Dependencies**: 
   - Properly externalized native modules (sharp, bcrypt, pg-native)
   - **FIXED**: Added comprehensive externals list for Vite, Babel, TypeScript, and dev tools
   - **FIXED**: Prevented bundling of build tools that caused corruption
   - Maintained compatibility with Node.js runtime

5. **Production Optimization**:
   - **ENABLED**: Minification for production builds
   - **ENABLED**: Tree shaking for smaller bundle size
   - **REMOVED**: Problematic banner causing module conflicts
   - **VERIFIED**: No syntax errors in bundled output

### Deployment Verification

The build system has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Client builds successfully to `dist/public/`
- ✅ Server builds successfully to `dist/index.js`  
- ✅ All dependencies are properly handled
- ✅ Build outputs match deployment expectations
- ✅ Production start command works correctly

### Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Node.js Version**: Ensure deployment environment uses Node.js 18+
2. **Environment Variables**: Verify all required secrets are set
3. **Database Connection**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is configured
4. **Port Configuration**: Application uses PORT environment variable (default 5000)

### Production Environment Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- All environment variables from development
- PostgreSQL database connection
- Port 5000 available (or custom PORT env var)
