For the Avatar creation, I need an option other than the simple text to image process, where they can do the job in an Avatar Creation Game
Goal: Build a child-friendly avatar customization mini-game . 

Art Style: Simple, cartoony, and friendly—large buttons, bright colors, clear icons, no hyper-realistic models.

Features:

Start screen with "Create Your Big Sister" and "Randomize" buttons.

Modular avatar system with swappable parts:

Base body: 3–5 body types, 6–8 skin tones.

Hair: 10 styles, multiple colors.

Face: Eye shapes/colors, mouth expressions, freckles, glasses.

Clothing: Tops/bottoms or full outfits, shoes, color swatches.

Accessories: Hats, props (book, backpack, headphones), stickers.

Personality Card: Adds greeting text and idle animation.

Background scene: Bedroom, park, beach, study space.

Avatar name input field.

Save button to store avatar data locally

Option to “Take a Snapshot” (download PNG of final avatar).

Randomize button to shuffle selections.

Option to use the avatar as the base image for an AI-generation

Do a basic celebratory animation like a confetti burst on save.

Unlockable Items: (Stub this for now – just create a placeholder system that can later allow locked items to be unlocked after milestones).

Architecture:

Separate avatar assets by category (e.g., /assets/hair, /assets/clothes).

Data-driven structure using JSON for customization options.

Use a clean component-based design.

Future-ready: Keep code structured so that it can later be merged into a larger React Native or web-based app.

Clean, well-commented code.

Simple placeholder art (flat shapes/colors) where final illustrations will go later.(I would like an easy way for an admin to provided the art for this)

README file explaining how to run and expand the avatar creator.

Stretch Goal (if time allows):

Add light idle animations for the avatar (blinking, waving).

Add collectible card preview showing the avatar's name and personality choice.

Important: Keep everything safe and appropriate for children. Make the experience friendly, simple, and fun, similar to a mini-game on a kids’ website.
